<p><strong>SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.</strong></p>

<p>Enter&nbsp;Francisco&nbsp;and&nbsp;Barnardo, two sentinels.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
Who&rsquo;s there?</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br />
Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
Long live the King!</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br />
Barnardo?</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
He.</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br />
You come most carefully upon your hour.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
&rsquo;Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br />
For this relief much thanks. &rsquo;Tis bitter cold,<br />
And I am sick at heart.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
Have you had quiet guard?</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br />
Not a mouse stirring.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
Well, good night.<br />
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,<br />
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</p>

<p>Enter&nbsp;Horatio&nbsp;and&nbsp;Marcellus.</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br />
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
Friends to this ground.</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
And liegemen to the Dane.</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br />
Give you good night.</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
O, farewell, honest soldier, who hath reliev&rsquo;d you?</p>

<p>FRANCISCO.<br />
Barnardo has my place. Give you good-night.</p>

<p>[<em>Exit.</em>]</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
Holla, Barnardo!</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
Say, what, is Horatio there?</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
A piece of him.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
What, has this thing appear&rsquo;d again tonight?</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
I have seen nothing.</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
Horatio says &rsquo;tis but our fantasy,<br />
And will not let belief take hold of him<br />
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.<br />
Therefore I have entreated him along<br />
With us to watch the minutes of this night,<br />
That if again this apparition come<br />
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
Tush, tush, &rsquo;twill not appear.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
Sit down awhile,<br />
And let us once again assail your ears,<br />
That are so fortified against our story,<br />
What we two nights have seen.</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
Well, sit we down,<br />
And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
Last night of all,<br />
When yond same star that&rsquo;s westward from the pole,<br />
Had made his course t&rsquo;illume that part of heaven<br />
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,<br />
The bell then beating one&mdash;</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again.</p>

<p>Enter&nbsp;Ghost.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
In the same figure, like the King that&rsquo;s dead.</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.</p>

<p>BARNARDO<br />
It would be spoke to.</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
Question it, Horatio.</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
What art thou that usurp&rsquo;st this time of night,<br />
Together with that fair and warlike form<br />
In which the majesty of buried Denmark<br />
Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak.</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
It is offended.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
See, it stalks away.</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!</p>

<p>[<em>Exit&nbsp;Ghost.</em>]</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
&rsquo;Tis gone, and will not answer.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale.<br />
Is not this something more than fantasy?<br />
What think you on&rsquo;t?</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
Before my God, I might not this believe<br />
Without the sensible and true avouch<br />
Of mine own eyes.</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
Is it not like the King?</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
As thou art to thyself:<br />
Such was the very armour he had on<br />
When he th&rsquo;ambitious Norway combated;<br />
So frown&rsquo;d he once, when in an angry parle<br />
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br />
&rsquo;Tis strange.</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,<br />
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
In what particular thought to work I know not;<br />
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br />
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,<br />
Why this same strict and most observant watch<br />
So nightly toils the subject of the land,<br />
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon<br />
And foreign mart for implements of war;<br />
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br />
Does not divide the Sunday from the week.<br />
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste<br />
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:<br />
Who is&rsquo;t that can inform me?</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
That can I;<br />
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last King,<br />
Whose image even but now appear&rsquo;d to us,<br />
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br />
Thereto prick&rsquo;d on by a most emulate pride,<br />
Dar&rsquo;d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,<br />
For so this side of our known world esteem&rsquo;d him,<br />
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal&rsquo;d compact,<br />
Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br />
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands<br />
Which he stood seiz&rsquo;d of, to the conqueror;<br />
Against the which, a moiety competent<br />
Was gaged by our King; which had return&rsquo;d<br />
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br />
Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov&rsquo;nant<br />
And carriage of the article design&rsquo;d,<br />
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br />
Of unimproved mettle, hot and full,<br />
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,<br />
Shark&rsquo;d up a list of lawless resolutes,<br />
For food and diet, to some enterprise<br />
That hath a stomach in&rsquo;t; which is no other,<br />
As it doth well appear unto our state,<br />
But to recover of us by strong hand<br />
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br />
So by his father lost. And this, I take it,<br />
Is the main motive of our preparations,<br />
The source of this our watch, and the chief head<br />
Of this post-haste and rummage in the land.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
I think it be no other but e&rsquo;en so:<br />
Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br />
Comes armed through our watch so like the King<br />
That was and is the question of these wars.</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
A mote it is to trouble the mind&rsquo;s eye.<br />
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br />
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br />
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead<br />
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;<br />
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,<br />
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,<br />
Upon whose influence Neptune&rsquo;s empire stands,<br />
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.<br />
And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br />
As harbingers preceding still the fates<br />
And prologue to the omen coming on,<br />
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br />
Unto our climatures and countrymen.</p>

<p>Re-enter&nbsp;Ghost.</p>

<p>But, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!<br />
I&rsquo;ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!<br />
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,<br />
Speak to me.<br />
If there be any good thing to be done,<br />
That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,<br />
Speak to me.<br />
If thou art privy to thy country&rsquo;s fate,<br />
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,<br />
O speak!<br />
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life<br />
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,<br />
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,<br />
Speak of it. Stay, and speak!</p>

<p>[<em>The cock crows.</em>]</p>

<p>Stop it, Marcellus!</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
Do, if it will not stand.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
&rsquo;Tis here!</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
&rsquo;Tis here!</p>

<p>[<em>Exit&nbsp;Ghost.</em>]</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
&rsquo;Tis gone!<br />
We do it wrong, being so majestical,<br />
To offer it the show of violence,<br />
For it is as the air, invulnerable,<br />
And our vain blows malicious mockery.</p>

<p>BARNARDO.<br />
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
And then it started, like a guilty thing<br />
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard<br />
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,<br />
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat<br />
Awake the god of day; and at his warning,<br />
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br />
Th&rsquo;extravagant and erring spirit hies<br />
To his confine. And of the truth herein<br />
This present object made probation.</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
It faded on the crowing of the cock.<br />
Some say that ever &rsquo;gainst that season comes<br />
Wherein our Saviour&rsquo;s birth is celebrated,<br />
The bird of dawning singeth all night long;<br />
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,<br />
The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,<br />
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;<br />
So hallow&rsquo;d and so gracious is the time.</p>

<p>HORATIO.<br />
So have I heard, and do in part believe it.<br />
But look, the morn in russet mantle clad,<br />
Walks o&rsquo;er the dew of yon high eastward hill.<br />
Break we our watch up, and by my advice,<br />
Let us impart what we have seen tonight<br />
Unto young Hamlet; for upon my life,<br />
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.<br />
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,<br />
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</p>

<p>MARCELLUS.<br />
Let&rsquo;s do&rsquo;t, I pray, and I this morning know<br />
Where we shall find him most conveniently.</p>
